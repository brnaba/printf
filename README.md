# printf()
The printf project is a collaboration project by Barnaba juma, student of the ALX Software Engineering Programme, in which a function named "printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and prints data. Its prototype is the following:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Where **format** contains the string that is printed. As _printf() is variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.
